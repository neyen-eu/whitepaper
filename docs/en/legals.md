# Legal considerations

We have worked with specialized lawyers to define the framework in which we are evolving in order to respect French regulations in our activities.

## Issuance of shares in the form of tokens

The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has released its analysis of the legal regime of tokens in France. It is finally the nature of the issued token which allows to define its regime. To date, either the token enters the regime of digital assets and in particular the token, defined in article L.552-2 of the Monetary and Financial Code, or it enters the regime of the financial instruments of articles L.211-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code or of the vouchers appearing in article L.223-1 of the CMF. 

The shares being qualified as financial instruments we are in the framework of the regime of financial instruments.

We are in the framework of a STO (Security Token Offering) 

The AMF assimilates STO operations to IPOs and therefore subjects them to the Prospectus regulation which is the common law regime for public offerings of financial securities. 

This regulation requires the preparation of a summary information document (SID) for public offers of less than 8 million euros, calculated over 12 months and on the whole territory of the European Union. Therefore, we prepare a DIS for each real estate program. 

This document sets out, among other things, a description of the issuer's activity and project, together with forecast elements, a description of all the rights attached to the securities, a description of the statutory provisions and the risks associated with the issuer's activity and project.

This document will be public and indicated in the metadata of the security tokens


## Identity verification (KYC)

Under the regime of financial instruments of Articles L.211-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code, the shared electronic recording device (DEEP), here the blockchain, must present guarantees, particularly in terms of authentication, at least equivalent to those presented by an account registration. 

Thus, the DEEP must be designed and implemented in such a way as to guarantee the registration and integrity of the entries and to allow, directly or indirectly, to identify the owners of the securities, the nature and the number of securities held.

Within this framework, we have the obligation to proceed to an identity verification with the subscribers of the STO. 
The identity verification will be linked to an address of a portfolio of digital assets. 

The data collection will be done by a specialized provider and secured by us. The tools to store this data meet the security standards ISO 27001, ISO 27017 and ISO 27018.
