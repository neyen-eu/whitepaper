# Secondary market

The secondary market, in which company shares will be resold, will be deployed on Polygon.

Today, French legislation allows us to issue SAS shares in the form of digital assets. Obviously, these digital assets are subject to the same legislation as traditionally issued securities.

In this context, buyers of shares on our secondary market will have to undergo identity verification.

The legal procedures with the French administration regarding the redemption of the shares will be done by us. 
The signature of the documents necessary for the various transactions will be done digitally in order to make the administrative operations as fluid as possible.
