# The Business Model 

NEYEN's business model is based on the speed of execution of the constructions induced by the wood frame constructions which allow to have a reduced delivery time of the real estate assets.

Concerning the life cycle of the programs, it will be as follows:
- Search for the location
- Creation of the daughter company totally financed by NEYEN
- Sale on the secondary market of 49% of the shares of the daughter company.
- Once the program is completed, the daughter company is dissolved and the capital collected is redistributed to the owners of the shares.

The sale of the shares on our secondary market allows us to refinance ourselves and to start new programs quickly and thus have leverage on our growth.

In terms of geographical constraints, we have the logistics to deliver our buildings anywhere in France.  
Today, NEYEN controls the entire manufacturing chain.

All the structural part of the houses is manufactured in our workshop before being delivered and then assembled on site.

We will also work with referenced companies that will be dedicated to the projects.

This process maximizes construction and delivery times while increasing margins.
For the programs, we have a realization cost around 2000€ HT per square meter.
Our current production capacity is 12 houses/year. The final goal is to increase this capacity considerably.

We will propose different types of products, F2, F3, F4, F5 on the ground floor or on the first floor, individual or collective. 
On this production, we estimate our margin to be 25%.

For example, for a program of 6 bungalows of 110m2 each, the duration of turnkey realization will be about 4 to 6 months.
The production cost would be 1,320,000€ on which we estimate a margin of 25%, that is to say a final resale cost of 1,650,000€ on a program lasting 8 months including the finishing work.

On this basis we believe that a 4 month period to resell the shares of a program is reasonable as we can offer interesting returns on capital as shown below: 

646,800€ of share resold with 2,5% of fees is 16,170€ or a total of 662,970€.

The estimate of the return is 808,500€ which is a return of 145,530€.

That is to say a return on capital over 8 months of 21.9% and a return on capital on an annual basis of 32.85%.


As far as NEYEN is concerned, on this basis of real estate programs of 6 houses, we can estimate the following annual profits on the real estate development activity on a basis of two programs per year:


|                               |              |
|-------------------------------|-------------:|
| program costs                 | -2 640 000 € |
| shares resold                 | 1 293 500 €  |
| Resold fees                   | 32 340 €     |
| Capital gain on programs      | 1 683 500 €  |
|                               |              |
| Total                         | 369 340 €    |
