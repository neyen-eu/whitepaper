NEYEN is a fintech that wants to offer, on its own secondary market, shares of real estate development companies with high added value on the environmental issue.

The companies proposed on our secondary market will be daughter companies of NEYEN whose goal will be to carry out their respective real estate programs.

Regarding real estate development, we are specialized in wood-frame construction that meets current ecological standards such as the RE2020 standard and those to come.

Our buildings will be built for an average consumption of 15 kWH/m2.

In view of the current context, the energy consumption of homes becoming an increasingly important criterion for households, our timber frame constructions made of eco-materials are a very promising market. 

Our ambition is to be able to propose profitable financial products which participate actively in the ecological renewal of the French real estate stock because the ecological transition can also be made by new vectors of investments like ours.
